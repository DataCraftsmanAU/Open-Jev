# IR evidence bundle

The full original corpus has 200 families, 400 queries, 8,800 request cases and
11,600 typed records. The independent body audit passes. Six complete runtime
algorithms and the graded metric/holdout loader are implemented. **External
TREC evaluation and IR HF publication remain pending.** No training on this
corpus is claimed.

The pilot's 132 real HTTP responses contain 174 typed decisions across only
6 queries / 3 correlated system families. Pointwise/listwise replay uses
8 candidates per query. The probability-mass-strict nDCG@10 results are Noul
0.974823, pointwise Score 0.833333, listwise Choice 0.940929 and listwise Score
1.0. Pointwise Score has 5/6 complete queries; the one invalid 0.99 probability
vector makes its query contribute zero. Two-decimal scalar/probability rounding
uses a separately declared consistency bound, without normalizing responses.
Pairwise/setwise fixed local probes cannot reconstruct an adaptive heap run.

Generation/audit manifests record the operations performed at generation time;
their `model_inference_performed: false` fields are not claims that no later
pilot model run exists. Raw provider outputs remain in
`runs/provider-comparison-20260920/jev-ir-pilot/`, bound by the ranking report.
All of this evidence is separate from the frozen 189-request comparison.

See the [data/runtime documentation](../../docs/ir-control-data.md) for commands,
label semantics, limitations and the external holdout contract.
